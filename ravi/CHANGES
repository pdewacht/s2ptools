September 9, 2003 - BETA 0.5.3
   - Applied a patch by Andy Hefner to fix a fadeout bug in The Colonel's
     Bequest, which would hang after the sound stopped playing.

August 10, 2002 - BETA 0.5.2
   - Fixed stuck notes bug. Some previous versions may have incorrectly
     issued CC78 instead of CC7B to turn off all notes on a channel.

June 29, 2002 - release BETA 0.5.1
   - Added sanity check on running status mode. In the 1988 Christmas Card,
     the driver employs running status on the very first sound event. The
     Card still doesn't run properly, but the sanity check prevents a crash.

   - Based off of nosnd BETA 0.5

     offset in the resource
   - Moved to global volume scale of 0-63 instead of 0-15 for smoother fades
   - Ensure correct cue position in SeekSound
   
December 21, 2000 - release ALPHA 0.2
   - The percussion channel (channel 10) is now played regardless of whether
     or not it is flagged. This fixes the no percussion bug in SQIII and
     other games.
