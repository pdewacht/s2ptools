The gm driver is a General MIDI sound driver for Sierra's SCI0 games. This
covers games like Conquests of Camelot, Space Quest III, most copies of
King's Quest IV, Leisure Suit Larry III, and so on. The latest version of
this driver is available from http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rniyenga/sci.

The driver is licensed under the GNU GPL with specific permission for linking
with Sierra's SCI0 interpreter. Full details are available in the file
LICENSE. Source is available in the file gm.asm.

Thanks to Rickard Lind and Christoph Reichenbach of the FreeSCI team (see
http://freesci.linuxgames.com). Rickard wrote the patch mapping code in the
file midi.c, which is copyrighted by him and Christoph. The code was
translated into assembly for inclusion into this driver. Additionally,
instead of muting the channel, the driver defaults to piano when an
instrument could not be mapped.
